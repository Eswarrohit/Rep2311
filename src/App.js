          A bicycle, also called a pedal cycle, bike, push-bike or cycle, is a
          human-powered or motor-assisted, pedal-driven, single-track vehicle,
          with two wheels attached to a frame, one behind the other. A bicycle
          rider is called a cyclist, or bicyclist. Bicycles were introduced in
          the 19th century in Europe. By the early 21st century there were more
          than 1 billion bicycles.[1][2][3] There are many more bicycles than
          cars.[4][5][6] Bicycles are the principal means of transport in many
          regions. They also provide a popular form of recreation, and have been
          adapted for use as children's toys. Bicycles are used for fitness,
          military and police applications, courier services, bicycle racing,
          and artistic cycling.

          The "dandy horse",[19] also called Draisienne or Laufmaschine
          ("running machine"), was the first human means of transport to use
          only two wheels in tandem and was invented by the German Baron Karl
          von Drais. It is regarded as the first bicycle and von Drais is seen
          as the "father of the bicycle",[20][21][22][23] but it did not have
          pedals.[24][25][26][27] Von Drais introduced it to the public in
          Mannheim in 1817 and in Paris in 1818.[28][29] Its rider sat astride a
          wooden frame supported by two in-line wheels and pushed the vehicle
          along with his or her feet while steering the front wheel.

          Saddles also vary with rider preference, from the cushioned ones
          favored by short-distance riders to narrower saddles which allow more
          room for leg swings. Comfort depends on riding position. With comfort
          bikes and hybrids, cyclists sit high over the seat, their weight
          directed down onto the saddle, such that a wider and more cushioned
          saddle is preferable. For racing bikes where the rider is bent over,
          weight is more evenly distributed between the handlebars and saddle,
          the hips are flexed, and a narrower and harder saddle is more
          efficient. Differing saddle designs exist for male and female
          cyclists, accommodating the genders' differing anatomies and sit bone
          width measurements, although bikes typically are sold with saddles
          most appropriate for men. Suspension seat posts and seat springs
          provide comfort by absorbing shock but can add to the overall weight
          of the bicycle. A recumbent bicycle has a reclined chair-like seat
          that some riders find more comfortable than a saddle, especially
          riders who suffer from certain types of seat, back, neck, shoulder, or
          wrist pain. Recumbent bicycles may have either under-seat or over-seat

      <h3>Brakes</h3>
      <div className="partsDiv">
        <p>
          Bicycle brakes may be rim brakes, in which friction pads are
          compressed against the wheel rims; hub brakes, where the mechanism is
          contained within the wheel hub, or disc brakes, where pads act on a
          rotor attached to the hub. Most road bicycles use rim brakes, but some
          use disk brakes.[64] Disc brakes are more common for mountain bikes,
          tandems and recumbent bicycles than on other types of bicycles, due to
          their increased power, coupled with an increased weight and
          complexity.With hand-operated brakes, force is applied to brake levers
          mounted on the handlebars and transmitted via Bowden cables or
          hydraulic lines to the friction pads, which apply pressure to the
          braking surface, causing friction which slows the bicycle down. A rear
          hub brake may be either hand-operated or pedal-actuated, as in the
          back pedal coaster brakes which were popular in North America until
          the 1960s. Track bicycles do not have brakes, because all riders ride
          in the same direction around a track which does not necessitate sharp
          deceleration. Track riders are still able to slow down because all
          track bicycles are fixed-gear, meaning that there is no freewheel.
          Without a freewheel, coasting is impossible, so when the rear wheel is
          moving, the cranks are moving. To slow down, the rider applies
          resistance to the pedals, acting as a braking system which can be as
          effective as a conventional rear wheel brake, but not as effective as
          a front wheel brake.[66]

      <img src="./Cycle/poverty.jpg"></img>
      <div className="partsDiv">
        <p>
          Bicycle poverty reduction is the concept that access to bicycles and
          the transportation infrastructure to support them can dramatically
          reduce poverty.This has been demonstrated in various pilot projects in
          South Asia and Africa. Experiments done in Africa (Uganda and
          Tanzania) and Sri Lanka on hundreds of households have shown that a
          bicycle can increase the income of a poor family by as much as 35%.
          Transport, if analyzed for the cost–benefit analysis for rural poverty
          alleviation, has given one of the best returns in this regard. For

          effective than almost all other investments and subsidies in rural
          economy in the decade of the 1990s. A road can ease transport on a
          macro level, while bicycle access supports it at the micro level. In

<h3>Road Bicycle Racing</h3>
      <img src="./Cycle/racing.jpg"></img>
      <div className="partsDiv" id="racingdiv">
        <p>Road bicycle racing is the cycle sport discipline of road cycling, held primarily on paved roads. Road racing is the most popular professional form of bicycle racing, in terms of numbers of competitors, events and spectators. The two most common competition formats are mass start events, where riders start simultaneously (though sometimes with a handicap) and race to a set finish point; and time trials, where individual riders or teams race a course alone against the clock. Stage races or "tours" take multiple days, and consist of several mass-start or time-trial stages ridden consecutively.

Professional racing originated in Western Europe, centred in France, Spain, Italy and the Low Countries. Since the mid-1980s, the sport has diversified, with races held at the professional, semi-professional and amateur levels, worldwide. The sport is governed by the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI). As well as the UCI's annual World Championships for men and women, the biggest event is the Tour de France, a three-week race that can attract over 500,000 roadside supporters a day.   Stage races consist of several races, or stages, ridden consecutively. The competitor with the lowest cumulative time to complete all stages is declared the overall, or general classification (GC), winner. Stage races may also have other classifications and awards, such as individual stage winners, the points classification winner, and the "King of the Mountains" (or mountains classification) winner. A stage race can also be a series of road races and individual time trials (some events include team time trials). The stage winner is the first person to cross the finish line that day or the time trial rider (or team) with the lowest time on the course. The overall winner of a stage race is the rider who takes the lowest aggregate time to complete all stages (accordingly, a rider does not have to win all or any of the individual stages to win overall). Three-week stage races are called Grand Tours. The professional road bicycle racing calendar includes three Grand Tours - the Giro d'Italia, the Tour de France, and the Vuelta a Espana.Ultra-distance cycling races are very long single stage events where the race clock continuously runs from start to finish. Their sanctioning bodies are usually independent of the UCI. They usually last several days and the riders take breaks on their own schedules, with the winner being the first one to cross the finish line. Among the best-known ultramarathons is the Race Across America (RAAM), a coast-to-coast non-stop, single-stage race in which riders cover approximately 3,000 miles (4,800 km) in about a week. The race is sanctioned by the UltraMarathon Cycling Association (UMCA). RAAM and similar events allow (and often require) racers to be supported by a team of staff; there are also ultra-distance bicycle races that prohibit all external support, such as the Transcontinental Race and the Indian Pacific Wheel Race.</p>

 <p>A ship is a large vessel that travels the world's oceans and other navigable waterways, carrying cargo or passengers, or in support of specialized missions, such as defense, research and fishing. Ships are generally distinguished from boats, based on size, shape, load capacity and purpose. Ships have supported exploration, trade, warfare, migration, colonization, and science. Ship transport is responsible for the largest portion of world commerce.The word ship has meant, depending on the era and the context, either just a large vessel or specifically a ship-rigged sailing ship with three or more masts, each of which is square-rigged.As of 2016, there were more than 49,000 merchant ships, totaling almost 1.8 billion deadweight tons. Of these 28% were oil tankers, 43% were bulk carriers, and 13% were container ships.
The earliest historical evidence of boats is found in Egypt during the 4th millennium BCE.

      <h1>Nomenclature</h1>
        <hr></hr>
      <div className='divp'>
         <p>Ships are typically larger than boats, but there is no universally accepted distinction between the two. Ships generally can remain at sea for longer periods of time than boats. A legal definition of ship from Indian case law is a vessel that carries goods by sea. A common notion is that a ship can carry a boat, but not vice versa. A ship is likely to have a full-time crew assigned. A US Navy rule of thumb is that ships heel towards the outside of a sharp turn, whereas boats heel towards the inside because of the relative location of the center of mass versus the center of buoyancy. American and British 19th century maritime law distinguished "vessels" from other watercraft; ships and boats fall in one legal category, whereas open boats and rafts are not considered vessels.
          Particularly in the Age of Sail, the word ship might apply generally to a seagoing vessel or particularly to a full-rigged sailing ship with three or more masts, all square-rigged. Other rigs on seagoing vessels included brig, barque, and barquentine

           <h1>History</h1>
      <hr></hr>
    <div>

      
      <p>For most of history, transport by ship – provided there is a feasible route – has generally been cheaper, safer and faster than making the same journey on land. Only the coming of railways in the middle of the 19th century and the growth of commercial aviation in the second half of the 20th century have changed this principle. This applied equally to sea crossings, coastal voyages and use of rivers and lakes.
       <br></br>Examples of the consequences of this include the large grain trade in the Mediterranean during the classical period. Cities such as Rome were totally reliant on the delivery by sailing ships of the large amounts of grain needed. It has been estimated that it cost less for a sailing ship of the Roman Empire to carry grain the length of the Mediterranean than to move the same amount 15 miles by road. Rome consumed about 150,000 tons of Egyptian grain each year over the first three centuries AD
       <br></br>Until recently, it was generally the case that a ship represented the most advanced representation of the technology that any society could achieve.

       <h2>Prehistory and antiquity</h2>
       <hr></hr>
       <div className='divp'>
       <h3>Asian developments</h3>
       <p>The earliest attestations of ships in maritime transport in Mesopotamia are model ships, which date back to the 4th millennium BC. In archaic texts in Uruk, Sumer, the ideogram for "ship" is attested, but in the inscriptions of the kings of Lagash, ships were first mentioned in connection to maritime trade and naval warfare at around 2500–2350 BCE.
        <br></br>Austronesian peoples originated in what is now Taiwan. From here, they took part in the Austronesian Expansion. Their distinctive maritime technology was integral to this movement and included catamarans and outriggers. It has been deduced that they had sails some time before 2000 BCE. Their crab claw sails enabled them to sail for vast distances in open ocean. From Taiwan, they rapidly colonized the islands of Maritime Southeast Asia, then sailed further onwards to Micronesia, Island Melanesia, Polynesia, and Madagascar, eventually colonizing a territory spanning half the globe.

          <br></br>Early Austronesian sailors influenced the development of sailing technologies in Sri Lanka and Southern India through the Austronesian maritime trade network of the Indian Ocean, the precursor to the spice trade route and the maritime silk road, which was established at around 1500 BC. The junk rigs of Chinese ships is also believed to be developed from tilted sails

       <p>In the 2nd century AD, people from the Indonesian archipelago already made large ships measuring over 50 m long and standing 4–7 m out of the water. They could carry 600–1000 people and 250–1000 ton cargo. These ships were known as kunlun bo or k'unlun po (崑崙舶, lit. "ship of the Kunlun people") by the Chinese, and kolandiaphonta by the Greeks. They had 4–7 masts and were able to sail against the wind due to the usage of tanja sails. These ships may have reached as far as Ghana In the 11th century, a new type of ship called djong or jong was recorded in Java and Bali.This type of ship was built using wooden dowels and treenails, unlike the kunlun bo which used vegetal fibres for lashings.
          <br></br>In China, miniature models of ships that feature steering oars have been dated to the Warring States period (c. 475–221 BC) By the Han dynasty, a well kept naval fleet was an integral part of the military. Sternpost-mounted rudders started to appear on Chinese ship models starting in the 1st century AD. However, these early Chinese ships were fluvial (riverine), and were not seaworthy. The Chinese only acquired sea-going ship technologies in the 10th century AD Song Dynasty after contact with Southeast Asian k'un-lun po trading ships, leading to the development of the junks.

     <h3>Mediterranean developments</h3>
     <div className='divp'>
      <p>The earliest historical evidence of boats is found in Egypt during the 4th millennium BCE [2] The Greek historian and geographer Agatharchides had documented ship-faring among the early Egyptians: "During the prosperous period of the Old Kingdom, between the 30th and 25th centuries BC, the river-routes were kept in order, and Egyptian ships sailed the Red Sea as far as the myrrh-country."[38] Sneferu's ancient cedar wood ship Praise of the Two Lands is the first reference recorded (2613 BC) to a ship being referred to by name.
        <br></br>The ancient Egyptians were perfectly at ease building sailboats. A remarkable example of their shipbuilding skills was the Khufu ship, a vessel 143 feet (44 m) in length entombed at the foot of the Great Pyramid of Giza around 2500 BC and found intact in 1954.
        <br></br>The oldest discovered sea faring hulled boat is the Late Bronze Age Uluburun shipwreck off the coast of Turkey, dating back to 1300 BC.
        <br></br>By 1200 B.C., the Phoenicians were building large merchant ships. In world maritime history, declares Richard Woodman, they are recognized as "the first true seafarers, founding the art of pilotage, cabotage, and navigation" and the architects of "the first true ship, built of planks, capable of carrying a deadweight cargo and being sailed and steered.

      <h3>Asian developments</h3>
      <div className='divp'>
        <p>At this time, ships were developing in Asia in much the same way as Europe.[according to whom?] Japan used defensive naval techniques in the Mongol invasions of Japan in 1281. It is likely that the Mongols of the time took advantage of both European and Asian shipbuilding techniques.[according to whom?] During the 15th century, China's Ming dynasty assembled one of the largest and most powerful naval fleets in the world for the diplomatic and power projection voyages of Zheng He. Elsewhere in Japan in the 15th century, one of the world's first iron-clads, "Tekkōsen" (鉄甲船), literally meaning "iron ships",[42] was also developed. In Japan, during the Sengoku era from the 15th century to 17th century, the great struggle for feudal supremacy was fought, in part, by coastal fleets of several hundred boats, including the atakebune. In Korea, in the early 15th century during the Joseon era, "Geobukseon"(거북선), was developed.

      <p>The empire of Majapahit used large ships called jong, built in northern Java, for transporting troops overseas. The jongs were transport ships which could carry 100–2000 tons of cargo and 50–1000 people, 28.99–88.56 meter in length.The exact number of jong fielded by Majapahit is unknown, but the largest number of jong deployed in an expedition is about 400 jongs, when Majapahit attacked Pasai, in 1350.

<h3>European developments</h3>
    <div className='divp'>
<p>Several civilizations became sea powers. Such examples include the maritime republics of Genoa and Venice, Hanseatic League, and the Byzantine navy. The Vikings used their knarrs to explore North America, trade in the Baltic Sea and plunder many of the coastal regions of Western Europe.</p>
 <p>Towards the end of the 14th century, ships like the carrack began to develop towers on the bow and stern. These towers decreased the vessel's stability, and in the 15th century, the caravel, designed by the Portuguese, based on the Arabic qarib[citation needed] which could sail closer to the wind, became more widely used. The towers were gradually replaced by the forecastle and sterncastle, as in the carrack Santa María of Christopher Columbus. This increased freeboard allowed another innovation: the freeing port, and the artillery associated with it.</p>

  </div>
  <p>The carrack was developed in Portugal, the Crown of Castile and the Crown of Aragon, then the caravel was developed in Portugal and the galleon was developed in Spain. After Columbus, European exploration rapidly accelerated, and many new trade routes were established.[46] In 1498, by reaching India, Vasco da Gama proved that access to the Indian Ocean from the Atlantic was possible. These explorations in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans were soon followed by France, England and the Netherlands, who explored the Portuguese and Spanish trade routes into the Pacific Ocean, reaching Australia in 1606 and New Zealand in 1642.[47] After the 15th century, new crops that had come from and to the Americas via the European seafarers significantly contributed to world population growth</p>

  <h2>Specialization and modernization</h2>
  <br></br>
  <div className='divp'>
    <p>Parallel to the development of warships, ships in service of marine fishery and trade also developed in the period between antiquity and the Renaissance</p>
    <p>Maritime trade was driven by the development of shipping companies with significant financial resources. Canal barges, towed by draft animals on an adjacent towpath, contended with the railway up to and past the early days of the industrial revolution. Flat-bottomed and flexible scow boats also became widely used for transporting small cargoes. Mercantile trade went hand-in-hand with exploration, self-financed by the commercial benefits of exploration</p>
    <p>During the first half of the 18th century, the French Navy began to develop a new type of vessel known as a ship of the line, featuring seventy-four guns. This type of ship became the backbone of all European fighting fleets. These ships were 56 metres (184 ft) long and their construction required 2,800 oak trees and 40 kilometres (25 mi) of rope; they carried a crew of about 800 sailors and soldiers.</p>
    <p>During the 19th century the Royal Navy enforced a ban on the slave trade, acted to suppress piracy, and continued to map the world. A clipper was a very fast sailing ship of the 19th century. The clipper routes fell into commercial disuse with the introduction of steam ships with better fuel efficiency, and the opening of the Suez and Panama Canals.</p>
    <p>Ship designs stayed fairly unchanged until the late 19th century. The industrial revolution, new mechanical methods of propulsion, and the ability to construct ships from metal triggered an explosion in ship design. Factors including the quest for more efficient ships, the end of long running and wasteful maritime conflicts, and the increased financial capacity of industrial powers created an avalanche of more specialized boats and ships. Ships built for entirely new functions, such as firefighting, rescue, and research, also began to appear.</p>

          solving the problem of flight control in three dimensions. Once the

          <h2>
            On the evening of Sept. 18, 1901, Wilbur Wright, a 33-year-old
            businessman from Dayton, Ohio, addressed a distinguished group of
            Chicago engineers on the subject of “Some Aeronautical Experiments”
            that he had conducted with his brother Orville Wright over the
            previous two years. “The difficulties which obstruct the pathway to
            success in flying machine construction,” he noted, “are of three
            general classes.” The 1909 Wright Military Flyer is the world's
            first military airplane. In 1908, the U.S. Army Signal Corps sought
            competitive bids for a two-seat observation aircraft. On June 3,
            1909, the Wrights returned to Fort Myer with a new airplane to
            complete the trials begun in 1908, that were cut short by a crash.
            Satisfying all requirements, the Army purchased the airplane for
            $30,000, and conducted flight training with it at nearby College
            Park, Maryland, and at Fort Sam Houston, in San Antonio, Texas, in
            1910. It was donated to the Smithsonian in 1911.The Roar of the
            Crowd The Wright brothers made their first public flights in Europe
            and America in 1908, bringing their invention to the masses.
            Airplane companies soon began to field teams to demonstrate the
            flying machines they produced. The daring aviators who participated
            in exhibitions and air meets became huge celebrities. They created
            the first great public enthusiasm for the airplane as a symbol of
            human achievement as the airplane took its first steps toward
            becoming a world changing technology.

            The work of the Wright brothers inspired an entire generation of
            flying-machine experimenters in Europe and the Americas. The
            Brazilian experimenter Alberto Santos-Dumont, for instance, made the
            first public flight in Europe in 1906 in his 14-bis. Frenchman Henri
            Farman made his first flight the following year in the Farman III, a
            machine built by Gabriel Voisin. Farman also completed the first
            European circular flight of at least 1 km (0.62 mile) early in 1908.
            On July 4, 1908, the American Glenn Hammond Curtiss, a leading
            member of the Aerial Experiment Association (AEA), organized by
            Alexander Graham Bell, won the Scientific American Trophy for a
            flight of 1 km in the AEA June Bug. The Santos-Dumont, Voisin, and
            Curtiss machines were all canard (elevator on the nose) biplanes
            with pusher propellers that were clearly inspired by what the
            designers knew of the work of the Wright brothers.Aviation pioneers
            are people directly and indirectly responsible for the advancement
            of flight, including people who worked to achieve manned flight
            before the invention of aircraft, as well as others who achieved
            significant "firsts" in aviation after heavier-than-air flight
            became routine. Pioneers of aviation have contributed to the
            development of aeronautics in one or more ways: through science and
            theory, theoretical or applied design, by constructing models or
            experimental prototype

            The first airline was the German airship company DELAG, founded on
            November 16, 1909. The four oldest non-airship airlines that still
            exist are the Netherlands' KLM (1919), Colombia's Avianca (1919),
            Australia's Qantas (1920) and the Russian Aeroflot (1923).The
            world’s first regularly scheduled heavier-than-air airline took off
            from the Municipal Pier in St. Petersburg on New Year’s Day 1914.
            The airline was known as the St. Petersburg–Tampa Airboat Line. It
            was organized just a few months before that New Year’s first
            takeoff. The airline was the brainchild of Percival E. Fansler, a
            Jacksonville-based electrical engineer. Fansler enlisted the support
            of Thomas Benoist (pronounced ben-wah), an early airplane
            manufacturer who provided the planes-or, more precisely, the
            airboats. The airboat was known as Benoist Airboat Model XIV, no.
            43. The model number referred to the year in which the plane was to
            be offered for sale (1914). The number indicated that it was the
            forty-third aircraft to be built from initiation of the Benoist
            Aeroplane Company.

          When risk is measured by deaths per passenger kilometer, air travel is
          approximately 10 times safer than travel by bus or rail. However, when
          using the deaths per journey statistic, air travel is significantly
          more dangerous than car, rail, or bus travel.[57] Air travel insurance
          is relatively expensive for this reason—insurers generally use the
          deaths per journey statistic.[58] There is a significant difference
          between the safety of airliners and that of smaller private planes,
          with the per-mile statistic indicating that airliners are 8.3 times
          safer than smaller planes.[59]

          Like all activities involving combustion, fossil-fuel-powered aircraft
          release soot and other pollutants into the atmosphere. Greenhouse
          gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2) are also produced. In addition,
          there are environmental impacts specific to airplanes: for instance,
          Airplanes operating at high altitudes near the tropopause (mainly
          large jet airliners) emit aerosols and leave contrails, both of which
          can increase cirrus cloud formation – cloud cover may have increased
          by up to 0.2% since the birth of aviation.[60] Airplanes operating at
          high altitudes near the tropopause can also release chemicals that
          interact with greenhouse gases at those altitudes, particularly
          nitrogen compounds, which interact with ozone, increasing ozone
          concentrations.[61][62] Most light piston aircraft burn avgas, which
          contains tetraethyllead (TEL). Some lower-compression piston engines
          can operate on unleaded mogas and turbine engines and diesel engines –
          neither of which require lead – are used on some newer light aircraft.
          Some non-polluting light electric aircraft are already in production.
          Another environmental impact of airplanes is noise pollution, mainly
          caused by aircraft taking off and landing.
