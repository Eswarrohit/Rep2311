          A <b>bullock cart or ox cart </b>(sometimes called a bullock carriage when
          carrying people in particular) is a two-wheeled or four-wheeled
          vehicle pulled by oxen. It is a means of transportation used since
          ancient times in many parts of the world. They are still used today
          where modern vehicles are too expensive or the infrastructure favor
          them.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>Used especially for carrying goods, the bullock cart is
          pulled by one or several oxen. The cart is attached to an ox team by a
          special chain attached to yokes, but a rope may also be used for one
          or two animals. The driver and any other passengers sit on the front
          of the cart, while load is placed in the back. Traditionally, the
          cargo was usually agrarian goods and lumber.

      <h2>History</h2>
      <hr></hr>
      <p style={{ width: "100%" }}>
        The first indications for the use of a wagon (cart tracks, incisions,
        model wheels) are dated to around 4400 BC. The oldest wooden wheels
        usable for transport were found in southern Russia and dated to 3325 ±
        125 BC.Evidence of wheeled vehicles appears from the mid 4th millennium
        BC between the North Sea and Mesopotamia. The earliest vehicles may have
        been ox carts.

      <h2>Australia</h2>
      <hr></hr>
      <div>
        <p>
          In Australia, bullock carts were referred to as bullock drays, had
          four wheels, and were usually used to carry large loads. Drays were
          pulled by bullock teams which could consist of 20 or more animals. The
          driver of a bullock team was known as a 'bullocky'.<br></br>
          <br></br>Bullock teams were used extensively to transport produce from
          rural areas to major towns and ports. Because of Australia's size,
          these journeys often covered large distances and could take many days
          and even weeks.

          {" "}
          In Costa Rica, ox carts (carretas in the Spanish language) were an
          important aspect of daily life and commerce, especially between 1850
          and 1935, developing a unique construction and decoration tradition
          that is still being developed. Costa Rican parades and traditional
          celebrations are not complete without a traditional ox cart parade.
          <br></br>
          <br></br> In 1988, the traditional ox cart was declared as National
          Symbol of Work by the Costa Rican government. <br></br>
          <br></br>In 2005, the "Oxherding and Oxcart Traditions in Costa Rica"
          were included in UNESCO's Representative List of the Intangible
          Cultural Heritage of Humanity.

          A bicycle, also called a pedal cycle, bike, push-bike or cycle, is a
          human-powered or motor-assisted, pedal-driven, single-track vehicle,
          with two wheels attached to a frame, one behind the other. A bicycle
          rider is called a cyclist, or bicyclist. Bicycles were introduced in
          the 19th century in Europe. By the early 21st century there were more
          than 1 billion bicycles.[1][2][3] There are many more bicycles than
          cars.[4][5][6] Bicycles are the principal means of transport in many
          regions. They also provide a popular form of recreation, and have been
          adapted for use as children's toys. Bicycles are used for fitness,
          military and police applications, courier services, bicycle racing,
          and artistic cycling.

          von Drais. It is regarded as the first bicycle and von Drais is seen
          as the "father of the bicycle",[20][21][22][23] but it did not have
          pedals.[24][25][26][27] Von Drais introduced it to the public in
          Mannheim in 1817 and in Paris in 1818.[28][29] Its rider sat astride a
          wooden frame supported by two in-line wheels and pushed the vehicle
          along with his or her feet while steering the front wheel.

          Saddles also vary with rider preference, from the cushioned ones
          favored by short-distance riders to narrower saddles which allow more
          room for leg swings. Comfort depends on riding position. With comfort
          bikes and hybrids, cyclists sit high over the seat, their weight
          directed down onto the saddle, such that a wider and more cushioned
          saddle is preferable. For racing bikes where the rider is bent over,
          weight is more evenly distributed between the handlebars and saddle,
          the hips are flexed, and a narrower and harder saddle is more
          efficient. Differing saddle designs exist for male and female
          cyclists, accommodating the genders' differing anatomies and sit bone
          width measurements, although bikes typically are sold with saddles
          most appropriate for men. Suspension seat posts and seat springs
          provide comfort by absorbing shock but can add to the overall weight
          of the bicycle. A recumbent bicycle has a reclined chair-like seat
          that some riders find more comfortable than a saddle, especially
          riders who suffer from certain types of seat, back, neck, shoulder, or
          wrist pain. Recumbent bicycles may have either under-seat or over-seat
          steeringSaddles also vary with rider preference, from the cushioned

      <h3>Brakes</h3>
      <div className="partsDiv">
        <p>
          Bicycle brakes may be rim brakes, in which friction pads are
          compressed against the wheel rims; hub brakes, where the mechanism is
          contained within the wheel hub, or disc brakes, where pads act on a
          rotor attached to the hub. Most road bicycles use rim brakes, but some
          use disk brakes.[64] Disc brakes are more common for mountain bikes,
          tandems and recumbent bicycles than on other types of bicycles, due to
          their increased power, coupled with an increased weight and
          complexity.With hand-operated brakes, force is applied to brake levers
          mounted on the handlebars and transmitted via Bowden cables or
          hydraulic lines to the friction pads, which apply pressure to the
          braking surface, causing friction which slows the bicycle down. A rear
          hub brake may be either hand-operated or pedal-actuated, as in the
          back pedal coaster brakes which were popular in North America until
          the 1960s. Track bicycles do not have brakes, because all riders ride
          in the same direction around a track which does not necessitate sharp
          deceleration. Track riders are still able to slow down because all
          track bicycles are fixed-gear, meaning that there is no freewheel.
          Without a freewheel, coasting is impossible, so when the rear wheel is
          moving, the cranks are moving. To slow down, the rider applies
          resistance to the pedals, acting as a braking system which can be as
          effective as a conventional rear wheel brake, but not as effective as
          a front wheel brake.[66]

      <img src="./Cycle/poverty.jpg"></img>
      <div className="partsDiv">
        <p>
          Bicycle poverty reduction is the concept that access to bicycles and
          the transportation infrastructure to support them can dramatically
          reduce poverty.This has been demonstrated in various pilot projects in
          South Asia and Africa. Experiments done in Africa (Uganda and
          Tanzania) and Sri Lanka on hundreds of households have shown that a
          bicycle can increase the income of a poor family by as much as 35%.
          Transport, if analyzed for the cost–benefit analysis for rural poverty
          alleviation, has given one of the best returns in this regard. For
          example, road investments in India were a staggering 3–10 times more
          effective than almost all other investments and subsidies in rural
          economy in the decade of the 1990s. A road can ease transport on a
          macro level, while bicycle access supports it at the micro level. In

<h3>Road Bicycle Racing</h3>
      <img src="./Cycle/racing.jpg"></img>
      <div className="partsDiv" id="racingdiv">
        <p>Road bicycle racing is the cycle sport discipline of road cycling, held primarily on paved roads. Road racing is the most popular professional form of bicycle racing, in terms of numbers of competitors, events and spectators. The two most common competition formats are mass start events, where riders start simultaneously (though sometimes with a handicap) and race to a set finish point; and time trials, where individual riders or teams race a course alone against the clock. Stage races or "tours" take multiple days, and consist of several mass-start or time-trial stages ridden consecutively.

Professional racing originated in Western Europe, centred in France, Spain, Italy and the Low Countries. Since the mid-1980s, the sport has diversified, with races held at the professional, semi-professional and amateur levels, worldwide. The sport is governed by the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI). As well as the UCI's annual World Championships for men and women, the biggest event is the Tour de France, a three-week race that can attract over 500,000 roadside supporters a day.   Stage races consist of several races, or stages, ridden consecutively. The competitor with the lowest cumulative time to complete all stages is declared the overall, or general classification (GC), winner. Stage races may also have other classifications and awards, such as individual stage winners, the points classification winner, and the "King of the Mountains" (or mountains classification) winner. A stage race can also be a series of road races and individual time trials (some events include team time trials). The stage winner is the first person to cross the finish line that day or the time trial rider (or team) with the lowest time on the course. The overall winner of a stage race is the rider who takes the lowest aggregate time to complete all stages (accordingly, a rider does not have to win all or any of the individual stages to win overall). Three-week stage races are called Grand Tours. The professional road bicycle racing calendar includes three Grand Tours - the Giro d'Italia, the Tour de France, and the Vuelta a Espana.Ultra-distance cycling races are very long single stage events where the race clock continuously runs from start to finish. Their sanctioning bodies are usually independent of the UCI. They usually last several days and the riders take breaks on their own schedules, with the winner being the first one to cross the finish line. Among the best-known ultramarathons is the Race Across America (RAAM), a coast-to-coast non-stop, single-stage race in which riders cover approximately 3,000 miles (4,800 km) in about a week. The race is sanctioned by the UltraMarathon Cycling Association (UMCA). RAAM and similar events allow (and often require) racers to be supported by a team of staff; there are also ultra-distance bicycle races that prohibit all external support, such as the Transcontinental Race and the Indian Pacific Wheel Race.</p>

        <h2>Article</h2>

        <p className="article">
          A motorcycle (motorbike, bike, or, if three-wheeled, a trike) is a two
          or three-wheeled motor vehicle steered by a handlebar from a
          saddle-style seat.<br></br>
          <br></br>
          Motorcycle design varies greatly to suit a range of different
          purposes: long-distance travel, commuting, cruising, sport (including
          racing), and off-road riding. Motorcycling is riding a motorcycle and
          being involved in other related social activities such as joining a
          motorcycle club and attending motorcycle rallies.<br></br>
          <br></br> The 1885 Daimler Reitwagen made by Gottlieb Daimler and
          Wilhelm Maybach in Germany was the first internal combustion,
          petroleum-fueled motorcycle. In 1894, Hildebrand & Wolfmüller became
          the first series production motorcycle.<br></br>
          <br></br>[4][5] Globally, motorcycles are comparably popular to cars
          as a method of transport. In 2021, approximately 58.6 million new
          motorcycles were sold around the world,[6] fewer than the 66.7 million
          cars sold over the same period.<br></br>
          <br></br> In 2022, the top four motorcycle producers by volume and
          type were Honda, Yamaha, Kawasaki, and Suzuki.[8] In developing
          countries, motorcycles are considered utilitarian due to lower prices
          and greater fuel economy. Of all the motorcycles in the world, 58% are
          in the Asia-Pacific and Southern and Eastern Asia regions, excluding
          car-centric Japan.<br></br>
          <br></br> According to the US Department of Transportation, the number
          of fatalities per vehicle mile traveled was 37 times higher for
          motorcycles than for cars.[9]

        <h2>Main article: Types of motorcycles</h2>
        <p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>
          The term motorcycle has different legal definitions depending on
          jurisdiction (see § Legal definitions and restrictions). There are
          three major types of motorcycle: street, off-road, and dual purpose.
          Within these types, there are many sub-types of motorcycles for
          different purposes. There is often a racing counterpart to each type,
          such as road racing and street bikes, or motocross including dirt
          bikes. Street bikes include cruisers, sportbikes, scooters and mopeds,
          and many other types. Off-road motorcycles include many types designed
          for dirt-oriented racing classes such as motocross and are not street
          legal in most areas. Dual purpose machines like the dual-sport style
          are made to go off-road but include features to make them legal and
          comfortable on the street as well. Each configuration offers either
          specialised advantage or broad capability, and each design creates a
          different riding posture. In some countries the use of pillions (rear
          seats) is restricted.

          <h3>Experimentation and invention</h3>
          <p>
            The first internal combustion, petroleum-fueled motorcycle was the
            Daimler Reitwagen. It was designed and built by the German inventors
            Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach in Bad Cannstatt, Germany, in
            1885. This vehicle was unlike either the safety bicycles or the
            boneshaker bicycles of the era in that it had zero degrees of
            steering axis angle and no fork offset, and thus did not use the
            principles of bicycle and motorcycle dynamics developed nearly 70
            years earlier. Instead, it relied on two outrigger wheels to remain
            upright while turning. The inventors called their invention the
            Reitwagen ("riding car"). It was designed as an expedient testbed
            for their new engine, rather than a true prototype vehicle.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first commercial design for a self-propelled cycle was a
            three-wheel design called the Butler Petrol Cycle, conceived by
            Edward Butler in England in 1884. He exhibited his plans for the
            vehicle at the Stanley Cycle Show in London in 1884. The vehicle was
            built by the Merryweather Fire Engine company in Greenwich, in 1888.
            The Butler Petrol Cycle was a three-wheeled vehicle, with the rear
            wheel directly driven by a 5⁄8 hp (0.47 kW), 40 cc (2.4 cu in)
            displacement, 2+1⁄4 in × 5 in (57 mm × 127 mm) bore × stroke, flat
            twin four-stroke engine (with magneto ignition replaced by coil and
            battery) equipped with rotary valves and a float-fed carburettor
            (five years before Maybach) and Ackermann steering, all of which
            were state of the art at the time. Starting was by compressed air.
            The engine was liquid-cooled, with a radiator over the rear driving
            wheel. Speed was controlled by means of a throttle valve lever. No
            braking system was fitted; the vehicle was stopped by raising and
            lowering the rear driving wheel using a foot-operated lever; the
            weight of the machine was then borne by two small castor wheels. The
            driver was seated between the front wheels. It was not, however, a
            success, as Butler failed to find sufficient financial backing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many authorities have excluded steam-powered, electric motorcycles,
            or diesel-powered two-wheelers from the definition of a
            'motorcycle', and credit the Daimler Reitwagen as the world's first
            motorcycle. Given the rapid rise in use of electric motorcycles
            worldwide, defining only internal-combustion powered two-wheelers as
            'motorcycles' is increasingly problematic. The first (petroleum
            fueled) internal-combustion motorcycles, like the German Reitwagen,
            were, however, also the first practical motorcycles. If a
            two-wheeled vehicle with steam propulsion is considered a
            motorcycle, then the first motorcycles built seem to be the French
            Michaux-Perreaux steam velocipede which patent application was filed
            in December 1868, constructed around the same time as the American
            Roper steam velocipede, built by Sylvester H. Roper of Roxbury,
            Massachusetts, who had been demonstrating his machine at fairs and
            circuses in the eastern U.S. since 1867. Roper built about 10 steam
            cars and cycles from the 1860s until his death in 1896.

        <h2>First motorcycle companies</h2>
        
        <div className="world">
        <p>
          In 1894, Hildebrand & Wolfmüller became the first series production
          motorcycle, and the first to be called a motorcycle (German:
          Motorrad).Excelsior Motor Company, originally a
          bicycle manufacturing company based in Coventry, England, began
          production of their first motorcycle model in 1896. The first
          production motorcycle in the US was the Orient-Aster, built by Charles
          Metz in 1898 at his factory in Waltham, Massachusetts. In the early
          period of motorcycle history, many producers of bicycles adapted their
          designs to accommodate the new internal combustion engine.<br></br><br></br> As the
          engines became more powerful and designs outgrew the bicycle origins,
          the number of motorcycle producers increased. Many of the
          nineteenth-century inventors who worked on early motorcycles often
          moved on to other inventions. Daimler and Roper, for example, both
          went on to develop automobiles.At the end of the 19th century the
          first major mass-production firms were set up. In 1898, Triumph
          Motorcycles in England began producing motorbikes, and by 1903 it was
          producing over 500 bikes. Other British firms were Royal Enfield,
          Norton, Douglas Motorcycles and Birmingham Small Arms Company who
          began motorbike production in 1899, 1902, 1907 and 1910,
          respectively.[24] Indian began production in 1901 and Harley-Davidson
          was established two years later. By the outbreak of World War I, the
          largest motorcycle manufacturer in the world was Indian,[25][26]
          producing over 20,000 bikes per year.[27]

        <h2>First World War</h2>
        <div className="world">

        <p>
          During the First World War, motorbike production was greatly ramped up
          for the war effort to supply effective communications with front line
          troops. Messengers on horses were replaced with despatch riders on
          motorcycles carrying messages, performing reconnaissance and acting as
          a military police. American company Harley-Davidson was devoting over
          50% of its factory output toward military contract by the end of the
          war. The British company Triumph Motorcycles sold more than 30,000 of
          its Triumph Type H model to allied forces during the war. With the
          rear wheel driven by a belt, the Model H was fitted with a 499 cc
          (30.5 cu in) air-cooled four-stroke single-cylinder engine. It was
          also the first Triumph without pedals.[28][better source needed] The
          Model H in particular, is regarded by many as having been the first
          "modern motorcycle".[29] Introduced in 1915 it had a 550 cc side-valve
          four-stroke engine with a three-speed gearbox and belt transmission.
          It was so popular with its users that it was nicknamed the "Trusty
          Triumph".[30]

        <h2>Postwar</h2>
        
      <div className="world">
      <p>
          By 1920, Harley-Davidson was the largest manufacturer, with their
          motorcycles being sold by dealers in 67 countries. Amongst
          many British motorcycle manufacturers, Chater-Lea with its
          twin-cylinder models followed by its large singles in the 1920s stood
          out. Initially, using converted a Woodmann-designed ohv Blackburne
          engine it became the first 350 cc to exceed 100 mph (160 km/h),
          recording 100.81 mph (162.24 km/h) over the flying kilometre during
          April 1924.[7] Later, Chater-Lea set a world record for the flying
          kilometre for 350 cc and 500 cc motorcycles at 102.9 mph (165.6 km/h)
          for the firm. Chater-Lea produced variants of these world-beating
          sports models and became popular among racers at the Isle of Man TT.
          Today, the firm is probably best remembered for its long-term contract
          to manufacture and supply AA Patrol motorcycles and sidecars.[citation
          needed] By the late 1920s or early 1930s, DKW in Germany took over as
          the largest manufacturer.

          In the 1950s, streamlining began to play an increasing part in the
          development of racing motorcycles and the "dustbin fairing" held out
          the possibility of radical changes to motorcycle design. NSU and Moto
          Guzzi were in the vanguard of this development, both producing very
          radical designs well ahead of their time.[37] NSU produced the most
          advanced design, but after the deaths of four NSU riders in the
          1954–1956 seasons, they abandoned further development and quit Grand
          Prix motorcycle racing.[38] Moto Guzzi produced competitive race
          machines, and until the end of 1957 had a succession of victories.[39]
          The following year, 1958, full enclosure fairings were banned from
          racing by the FIM in the light of the safety concerns. From the 1960s
          through the 1990s, small two-stroke motorcycles were popular
          worldwide, partly as a result of East German MZs Walter Kaaden's
          engine work in the 1950s.[40]

          In the 21st century, the motorcycle industry is mainly dominated by
          Indian and Japanese motorcycle companies. In addition to the large
          capacity motorcycles, there is a large market in smaller capacity
          (less than 300 cc) motorcycles, mostly concentrated in Asian and
          African countries and produced in China and India.[citation needed] A
          Japanese example is the 1958 Honda Super Cub, which went on to become
          the biggest selling vehicle of all time, with its 60 millionth unit
          produced in April 2008.[41] Today, this area is dominated by mostly
          Indian companies with Hero MotoCorp emerging as the world's largest
          manufacturer of two wheelers. Its Splendor model has sold more than
          8.5 million to date.[42] Other major producers are Bajaj and TVS

          2005 from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System show that for
          passenger cars, 18.62 fatal crashes occur per 100,000 registered
          vehicles. For motorcycles this figure is higher at 75.19 per 100,000
          registered vehicles – four times higher than for cars.[56] The same
          data shows that 1.56 fatalities occur per 100 million vehicle miles
          travelled for passenger cars, whereas for motorcycles the figure is
          43.47 which is 28 times higher than for cars (37 times more deaths per
          mile travelled in 2007).[9] Furthermore, for motorcycles the accident
          rates have increased significantly since the end of the 1990s, while

          The most common configuration of motorcycle accidents in the United
          States is when a motorist pulls out or turns in front of a
          motorcyclist, violating their right-of-way.[57] This is sometimes
          called a SMIDSY, an acronym formed from the motorists' common response
          of "Sorry mate, I didn't see you".[58] Motorcyclists can anticipate
          and avoid some of these crashes with proper training, increasing their
          visibility to other traffic, keeping to the speed limits, and not
          consuming alcohol or other drugs before riding.[59] The United Kingdom
          has several organisations dedicated to improving motorcycle safety by
          providing advanced rider training beyond what is necessary to pass the
          basic motorcycle licence test. These include the Institute of Advanced
          Motorists (IAM) and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents
          (RoSPA). Along with increased personal safety, riders with these
          advanced qualifications may benefit from reduced insurance costs[60]

        <h2>Environmental impact</h2>
        <p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>
          Motorcycles and scooters' low fuel consumption has attracted interest
          in the United States from environmentalists and those affected by
          increased fuel prices.[77][78] Piaggio Group Americas supported this
          interest with the launch of a "Vespanomics" website and platform,
          claiming lower per-mile carbon emissions of 0.4 lb/mile (113 g/km)
          less than the average car, a 65% reduction, and better fuel
          economy.[79] However, a motorcycle's exhaust emissions may contain
          10–20 times more oxides of nitrogen (NOx), carbon monoxide, and
          unburned hydrocarbons than exhaust from a similar-year passenger car
          or SUV.[77][80] This is because many motorcycles lack a catalytic
          converter, and the emission standard is much more permissive for
          motorcycles than for other vehicles.[77] While catalytic converters
          have been installed in most gasoline-powered cars and trucks since
          1975 in the United States, they can present fitment and heat
          difficulties in motorcycle applications.[77][better source needed]
          United States Environmental Protection Agency 2007 certification
          result reports for all vehicles versus on highway motorcycles (which
          also includes scooters),[81] the average certified emissions level for
          12,327 vehicles tested was 0.734. The average "Nox+Co
          End-Of-Useful-Life-Emissions" for 3,863 motorcycles tested was 0.8531.
          54% of the tested 2007-model motorcycles were equipped with a
          catalytic converter.

            On the evening of Sept. 18, 1901, Wilbur Wright, a 33-year-old
            businessman from Dayton, Ohio, addressed a distinguished group of
            Chicago engineers on the subject of “Some Aeronautical Experiments”
            that he had conducted with his brother Orville Wright over the
            previous two years. “The difficulties which obstruct the pathway to
            success in flying machine construction,” he noted, “are of three
            general classes.” The 1909 Wright Military Flyer is the world's
            first military airplane. In 1908, the U.S. Army Signal Corps sought
            competitive bids for a two-seat observation aircraft. On June 3,
            1909, the Wrights returned to Fort Myer with a new airplane to
            complete the trials begun in 1908, that were cut short by a crash.
            Satisfying all requirements, the Army purchased the airplane for
            $30,000, and conducted flight training with it at nearby College
            Park, Maryland, and at Fort Sam Houston, in San Antonio, Texas, in
            1910. It was donated to the Smithsonian in 1911.The Roar of the
            Crowd The Wright brothers made their first public flights in Europe
            and America in 1908, bringing their invention to the masses.
            Airplane companies soon began to field teams to demonstrate the
            flying machines they produced. The daring aviators who participated
            in exhibitions and air meets became huge celebrities. They created
            the first great public enthusiasm for the airplane as a symbol of
            human achievement as the airplane took its first steps toward
            becoming a world changing technology.

            The work of the Wright brothers inspired an entire generation of
            flying-machine experimenters in Europe and the Americas. The
            Brazilian experimenter Alberto Santos-Dumont, for instance, made the
            first public flight in Europe in 1906 in his 14-bis. Frenchman Henri
            Farman made his first flight the following year in the Farman III, a
            machine built by Gabriel Voisin. Farman also completed the first
            European circular flight of at least 1 km (0.62 mile) early in 1908.
            On July 4, 1908, the American Glenn Hammond Curtiss, a leading
            member of the Aerial Experiment Association (AEA), organized by
            Alexander Graham Bell, won the Scientific American Trophy for a
            flight of 1 km in the AEA June Bug. The Santos-Dumont, Voisin, and
            Curtiss machines were all canard (elevator on the nose) biplanes
            with pusher propellers that were clearly inspired by what the
            designers knew of the work of the Wright brothers.Aviation pioneers
            are people directly and indirectly responsible for the advancement
            of flight, including people who worked to achieve manned flight

            significant "firsts" in aviation after heavier-than-air flight
            became routine. Pioneers of aviation have contributed to the
            development of aeronautics in one or more ways: through science and
            theory, theoretical or applied design, by constructing models or

            The first airline was the German airship company DELAG, founded on
            November 16, 1909. The four oldest non-airship airlines that still
            exist are the Netherlands' KLM (1919), Colombia's Avianca (1919),
            Australia's Qantas (1920) and the Russian Aeroflot (1923).The
            world’s first regularly scheduled heavier-than-air airline took off
            from the Municipal Pier in St. Petersburg on New Year’s Day 1914.
            The airline was known as the St. Petersburg–Tampa Airboat Line. It
            was organized just a few months before that New Year’s first
            takeoff. The airline was the brainchild of Percival E. Fansler, a
            Jacksonville-based electrical engineer. Fansler enlisted the support
            of Thomas Benoist (pronounced ben-wah), an early airplane
            manufacturer who provided the planes-or, more precisely, the
            airboats. The airboat was known as Benoist Airboat Model XIV, no.
            43. The model number referred to the year in which the plane was to

          When risk is measured by deaths per passenger kilometer, air travel is
          approximately 10 times safer than travel by bus or rail. However, when
          using the deaths per journey statistic, air travel is significantly
          more dangerous than car, rail, or bus travel.[57] Air travel insurance
          is relatively expensive for this reason—insurers generally use the
          deaths per journey statistic.[58] There is a significant difference
          between the safety of airliners and that of smaller private planes,
          with the per-mile statistic indicating that airliners are 8.3 times
          safer than smaller planes.[59]

          Like all activities involving combustion, fossil-fuel-powered aircraft
          release soot and other pollutants into the atmosphere. Greenhouse
          gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2) are also produced. In addition,
          there are environmental impacts specific to airplanes: for instance,
          Airplanes operating at high altitudes near the tropopause (mainly
          large jet airliners) emit aerosols and leave contrails, both of which
          can increase cirrus cloud formation – cloud cover may have increased
          by up to 0.2% since the birth of aviation.[60] Airplanes operating at
          high altitudes near the tropopause can also release chemicals that
          interact with greenhouse gases at those altitudes, particularly
          nitrogen compounds, which interact with ozone, increasing ozone
          concentrations.[61][62] Most light piston aircraft burn avgas, which
          contains tetraethyllead (TEL). Some lower-compression piston engines
          can operate on unleaded mogas and turbine engines and diesel engines –
          neither of which require lead – are used on some newer light aircraft.
          Some non-polluting light electric aircraft are already in production.
          Another environmental impact of airplanes is noise pollution, mainly
          caused by aircraft taking off and landing.

          billion and accounts for 8% of the country's total exports and 7.1% of
          India's GDP.[5] According to the 2021 National Family Health Survey,
          barely 8% of Indian households own an automobile.[6][7] According to
          government statistics, India has barely 22 automobiles per 1,000
          people

            In 1897, the first car ran on an Indian road. Through the 1930s,
            cars were imports only, and in small numbers. An embryonic
            automotive industry emerged in India in the 1940s. Hindustan Motors
            was launched in 1942 building Morris products, long-time competitor
            Premier in 1944, building Chrysler Corporation products such as
            Dodge and Plymouth, and beginning in the 1960s, Fiat products.[10]
            Mahindra & Mahindra was established by two brothers in 1945 and
            began assembly of Jeep CJ-3A utility vehicles.<br></br> In the same
            years, J. R. D. Tata, the chairman of Tata Group founded TATA
            Engineering and Locomotive Company (now Tata Motors) in Jamshedpur.
            Following independence in 1947, the Government of India and the
            private sector launched efforts to create an automotive-component
            manufacturing industry to supply to the automobile industry. In
            1953, an import substitution programme was launched, and the import
            of fully built-up cars began to be restricted.

            In 1952, the Indian government appointed the first Tariff
            Commission, whose purpose was to come out with a feasibility plan
            for the indigenization of the Indian automobile industry. In 1953,
            the commission submitted its report, which recommended categorizing
            existing Indian car companies according to their manufacturing
            infrastructure, under a licensed capacity to manufacture a certain
            number of vehicles, with capacity increases allowable, as per
            demands, in the future.<br></br> The Tariff Commission
            recommendations were implemented with new policies that would
            eventually exclude companies that only imported parts for assembly,
            as well as those with no Indian partner.<br></br> In 1954, following
            the Tariff Commission implementation, General Motors, Ford, and
            Rootes Group, which had assembly-only plants in Mumbai, decided to
            move out of India.[11] The Tariff commission policies, including
            similar restrictions that applied to other industries, came to be
            known as the Licence Raj, which proved to be the greatest undoing of
            the Indian automotive industry, where bureaucratic red tape ended up
            causing demand to outstrip supply, with month-long waiting periods
            for cars, scooters, and motorcycles.

            The Hindustan Ambassador is an automobile that was manufactured by
            Hindustan Motors of India from 1957 to 2014, with improvements and
            changes over its production lifetime. The Ambassador was based on
            the Morris Oxford series III model, first made by Morris Motors
            Limited at Cowley, Oxford in the United Kingdom from 1956 to 1959.
            <br></br> Despite its British origins, the Ambassador was considered
            as a definitive Indian car and was fondly called the "King of Indian
            roads".[1] The automobile was manufactured by Hindustan Motors at
            its Uttarpara plant[2] near Kolkata, West Bengal. <br></br> On 11
            February 2017, Hindustan Motors executed an agreement with PSA Group
            for the sale of the Ambassador brand, including the trademarks, for
            a consideration of ₹80 crore (US$10 million).[3] The tie-up entailed
            two joint-venture agreements between the companies of the two
            groups.

        <h3>Design and development</h3>

        <div className="paragraphDiv">
          <p>
            The Ambassador was basically the same Morris Oxford Series - III,
            launched by Morris, then a part of British Motor Corporation. In
            1956 it sold the rights and tooling to Hindustan Motors as it had
            done for its previous Series - I and Series - II models which were
            sold by Hindustan Motors as Hindustan 14 and Landmaster. The Series
            -III model itself was a derivative of the Morris Oxford Series - II
            model which was developed prior to the Austin and Morris merger.
            <br></br> The car was quite spacious due to its semi-monocoque
            design which was quite an advancement in the early 1950s in vehicle
            engineering. The car was designed by Alec Issigonis whose other
            designs were the Mini and Morris Minor. The Ambassador replaced the
            Morris Oxford Series II based Hindustan Landmaster, which was quite
            similar, and the larger Hindustan Deluxe based on the Chevrolet
            Deluxe.

          <p>
            The political influence of the Birla family helped ensure that the
            Ambassador was one of the few cars that were in production following
            the 1954 government policy of promoting an indigenous Automobile
            industry. It dominated the market for several decades, mostly due to
            its spacious size and ruggedness compared to its rivals like the
            Premier Padmini and Standard 10.[4] By the early 1980s, the
            comparatively expensive Ambassador's low fuel economy and poor
            quality began to hinder sales.<br></br> It still represented more
            than two thirds of Indian car production, but wait lists were down
            to 12 months while the Premier Padmini had a wait list nearly five
            years long.[5] The Ambassador remained dominant in the official and
            company sectors, while also popular as a taxi, but private motorists
            gradually abandoned the "Amby" in the 1980s and 1990s.

            The Fiat 1100 is a small family car produced from 1953 until 1969 by
            the Italian manufacturer Fiat. It was an all-new unibody replacement
            for the Fiat 1100 E, which descended from the pre-war, body-on-frame
            Fiat 508 C Balilla 1100. <br></br> The 1100 was changed steadily and
            gradually until being replaced by the new Fiat 128 in 1969. There
            were also a series of light commercial versions of the 1100 built,
            with later models called the Fiat 1100T, which remained in
            production until 1971. The Fiat 1100 D also found a long life in
            India, where Premier Automobiles continued to build the car until
            the end of 2000

            Fiat 1100D, built under license by Premier Automobiles later
            re-christened 'Premier Padmini' was the Ambassador's only true

            The Fiat Nuova 1100, or Fiat 1100/103 as it was called after its
            internal project number, was introduced at the April 1953 Geneva
            Motor Show.[3][4] Unlike the 1100 E it replaced, the 103 had a
            modern four-door saloon pontoon body topping new unibody
            construction, both pioneered in Fiat's range by the 1950 1400.[4][5]
            If the 103's body was all-new, its engine was well-tested; the car's
            engine debuted in 1937 on the predecessor of the outgoing 1100 E,
            the 508 C Balilla 1100. Updated as type 103.000, the 1,089 cc (66 cu
            in) overhead valve four-cylinder was fed by a single Solex or Weber
            downdraught carburettor, and put out 36 PS CUNA (26 kW) at 4,400
            rpm—just one horsepower more than on the 1100 E.[4] The 4-speed
            manual transmission had synchromesh on the top three speeds and a
            column-mounted shifter, fashionable at the time.<br></br> The car
            could reach a top speed of 116 km/h (72 mph).[4] The new model was
            offered in two different versions: the spartan Tipo A and richer
            Tipo B. The former was only available in a grey-brown paint colour,
            had separate front seats instead of a bench, reduced, non-chromed
            exterior trim, and lacked a heater and ventilation.[4][6] The Type A
            right hand drive export models were only available in black. They
            were also equipped with a heater and ventilation system as well.
            <br></br> The Type A cars also came with slightly broader body trim
            strips compared to the Type B. On left hand drive versions of the
            both Type A and Type B cars, the dashboard contained a large plastic
            badge (on the right hand side) stating "Millecento" covering the
            orifice where a radio could be installed. However on the right hand
            drive cars, this badge which was located on the left hand side
            contained the wording Fiat 1100 on the Type A cars and Millecento on
            the Type B cars.<br></br> The type B came in a choice of paint hues
            and interior fabrics, and could be ordered with factory-fitted
            whitewall tyres and radio.[citation needed] A distinguishing feature
            of 103s throughout the 1950s were the doors, both hinged on the
            centre pillar;[4] this would only change in 1960, when the 1100
            started to adopt the more modern bodyshell of the Fiat 1200 saloon.
            <br></br> Unlike the earlier body-on-frame 1100 series, there was no
            NSU-developed two-door sedan model.
